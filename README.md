# KF_Infrastructure

`KF_Infrastructure` stands as a fundamental submodule in the KeysFortress ecosystem, dedicated to providing a robust foundation for both KeysFortress Mobile and KeysFortress Desktop applications. This submodule is designed to implement and manage the infrastructure layer within the context of clean architecture principles, offering essential services and functionalities required by the higher layers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of `KF_Infrastructure` is to encapsulate infrastructure-related concerns and services in a clean and modular manner. By adhering to clean architecture principles, this submodule ensures a separation of concerns, allowing for the independent development, testing, and evolution of infrastructure components.

## Key Features

### 1. Clean Architecture Principles

`KF_Infrastructure` strictly follows clean architecture principles, dividing the application into distinct layers: Presentation, Domain, and Infrastructure. This separation facilitates maintainability, scalability, and testability of the application as a whole.

### 2. Essential Services

Within `KF_Infrastructure`, essential services such as data persistence, network communication, and device-specific functionalities are implemented. These services act as the bridge between the higher layers (Presentation and Domain) and the external dependencies.

### 3. Submodule Integration

Being a submodule, `KF_Infrastructure` is seamlessly integrated into both KeysFortress Mobile and KeysFortress Desktop repositories. This integration ensures that the infrastructure layer is consistent across platforms, promoting code reuse and minimizing duplication of efforts.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance and extend infrastructure services are welcome. If you identify opportunities for improvement, new features, or optimizations, consider submitting a pull request to strengthen the foundation of KeysFortress.
